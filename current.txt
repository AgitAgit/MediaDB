TODO:
-Put the client app on render as well
-Populate the db using the spotify api. Each record should contain normal song data and also
if it is liked.(next there should be a login option to distinguish between the liked songs of each user)
------------------------------------------------
The current problem is possibly an incompatible node version used in render.
The version we originally use is:20.14.0
