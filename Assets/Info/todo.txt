    refactor the context provider so it feeds directly into the header

    Why are there songs appearing with a heart but not in the favorites?
    Maybe the favorites queries a different resource than the like button.
    
    favorites button relies on
    like button relies on the favSongs context

    Are there liked songs that don't appear on the favorites button?
    Or are the songs that appear liked even though they are not?

    Current problem:in searchBar.handleFavoritesClick, onSearchClick is called before the favBtnOn is updated, causing problems in the search.
    Fixed. I changed it so favBtnOn is stored in the search bar and not songs. Also fixed some wrong array
    spreading syntax.
    Current problem: After turning off the favorites mode, all the songs in the general search mode where
    favorites had been appear to be liked. 
    (Note, their id is not on the liked list. So perhaps the same card is kept only it's contents change?)
